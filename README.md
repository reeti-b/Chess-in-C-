### Chess-in-C-C-
## Implementation of Chess, playable in Terminal


# This is an implementation of Chess in C/C++. 
# The board provides a list of all possible valid moves, and flips every time someone makes a move
# It prevents people from making an illegal move. 
# The board also allows you to undo your previous move, by typing 'u'.
# Play a move by typing the initial square and the final square, e.g. a3a4

## Have fun!
